## **üìë Overview**
This is a mod for [Minecraft] [Forge].<br>
It will add additional Crafting Storages which can be used with [Applied Energistics 2][ae2].

They can be used to save space because the built-in Crafting Storages have a maximum capacity of 64k.

The crafting recipes use Storage Components from Extra Cells.<br>
Since v1.2.0, this mod supports all known forks as well as the original Extra Cells mod. Just make sure to only use one of them.

## **üîß Installation**

1. Download the latest **mod jar** from the [releases] or from [CurseForge].
2. Install Minecraft [Forge].
3. Install the dependency mods [Applied Energistics 2][ae2] and one of the Extra Cells mods.
4. Drop the **jar file** into your mods folder.


## **üêõ Limitations**
Due to how [Applied Energistics 2][ae2] is made and built, there is a limitation you have to keep in mind:

- the Crafting Storage blocks of this mod will only work if at least one Crafting Storage block of the original mod [Applied Energistics 2][ae2] is in the same multiblock, otherwise they are just not being recognized by the ME system
- whenever you build a multiblock with the new Crafting Storages make sure that a minimum of 1 block of an Applied Energistics Crafting Storage is also included in the same multiblock


## **üìï History**
This is a port of the [Extra Crafting Storage] mod by [Zokonius].

He discontinued his version and since it's running under the [GPL 3 license][license], I decided to update it.

It is basically a rewrite and just borrows the idea.<br>
After the first version was released, he joined the development of Extra CPUs.
