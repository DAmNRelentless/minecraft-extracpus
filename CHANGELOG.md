## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-21

### Notes
- although a lot of internal changes have been made in the mod, the new version is **still compatible** with your old world, nothing will be lost
- this update was only possible through the awesome author ([@Zoko061602][original author]) of the original [Extra Crafting Storage mod][original mod], thanks a lot!

### Changed
- block textures now connect properly within the mod
- blocks now also connect to original AE2 Crafting Storages
- blocks now emit light when in the dark while being powered
- remade some textures so they fit AE2 a bit more
- 4096k Crafting Storage is now pink for a visible difference to the 1k Crafting Storage
- general structure improvements and refactoring


## [1.0.0] - 2020-09-14
